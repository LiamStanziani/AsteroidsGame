# AsteroidsGame
A game made by me and Nathan Garrity that is a 2D space shooter, this was made for our final project for the course PROG2370. 

When you start the game, you will be on the main menu of the game, to move through the menu, you will need to click up arrow for going up the menu, and down arrow for
going down the menu, these can be clicked by pressing enter. The first option is to play the game, which you will be playing as a spaceship and you must avoid the
asteroids that will be moving around the screen by either using the arrow keys to move around or by pressing space and shooting the asteroids that are coming your way.
If you shoot an asteroid, it will disapear and this will give you 50 score. When you die you can either press the escape button to leave the game screen or you will
have the option to enter your name and press enter, which will allow you to be put on the high score screen if you have enough points to do better than another player.
The second screen will tell you how to play the game, the third screen will show you the highscores of the players that got a highscore, the fourth screen will mention 
the creators of the game, me and Nathan Garrity, and the fifth will allow you to quit the application
